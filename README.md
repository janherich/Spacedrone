# About Spacedrone
## Rationale

Spacedrone aims to approach quadrocopter design from very different angle, compared to existing projects.
It aims to utilise efficient spaceframe structures and aerodynamic principles to create very efficient quadcopter
design, with lowest in class weight and above average frame stiffness and aerodynamics.

Furthermore, it's fully parametric and scalable, covering wide range of sizes, from small sub 250g 4-5" builds to 
heavy lifters with 3115 and bigger motors.

## 5 inch racer
* [Project folder with build instructions and 3D print files](/5_inch_pyramid_drone)
* 40g complete frame weight with aerodynamic canopy
* ~250g average build weight with powerful 2207/2306 motors, 230g possible with top-spec motors and titanium hardware
* Perfect balance with bottom mounted battery, CG in the propeller plane
* Integral cable routing in hollow 7mm round arms, no braces or additional obstructions in propeller airflow
* Aerodynamic canopy with quick attach system housing camera, vtx and RX
* Almost totally clean camera view with just small parts of motors in bottom corners of the viewport, despite balanced true-X config
* Stiff frame capable of running agressive PID tunes without hot-motors/vibration problems

## 7 inch long range cruiser
* [Project folder with build instructions and 3D print files](/7_inch_pyramid_drone)
* 55g complete frame weight with aerodynamic canopy
* ~300g average build weight with efficient 2506/2604 motors, 280g possible with smaller, lower kv 2207 or similar sized motors
* Perfect balance with bottom mounted battery, CG in the propeller plane
* Integral cable routing in hollow 8mm round arms, no braces or additional obstructions in propeller airflow
* Aerodynamic canopy with quick attach system housing camera, vtx and RX
* Very clean camera view with just small parts of propellers/motors in bottom corners of the viewport, despite balanced true-X config
* Stiff frame capable of running agressive PID tunes without hot-motors/vibration problems
